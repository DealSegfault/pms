// turbo-all

## Steps

1. Read the master skill file to understand the overall plan:
   View file `.agents/skills/python-engine/SKILL.md`

2. Check the current task.md to see which step is next:
   View file at the artifact path for `task.md`

3. Read the SKILL.md for the next incomplete step (e.g., `.agents/skills/python-engine-step1/SKILL.md`)

4. Read ALL the source files listed in the skill's "Source Patterns to Reuse" section

5. Read the relevant `notes/*.md` documentation files listed in the skill

6. Implement the code exactly as specified in the skill

7. Run the validation commands listed at the bottom of the skill

8. Mark the step as complete in task.md (`[x]`)

9. Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "feat(python-engine): step N — description"`
